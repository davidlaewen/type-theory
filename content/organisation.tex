\subsection{Timeline}
The first five weeks of the lecture are based on Femke van Raamsdonk's
lecture notes from VU Amsterdam, as well as the corresponding Coq exercises.
The following three weeks will deal with some metatheory.
A written exam concludes the first half of the semester.

In the second half of the semester, students will present research papers
in groups of two.
Students will also individually work on a formalisation project in Coq,
which is to be handed in by 20th January.

The final grade is the average of the grades for the exam, presentation and
project.
